#RobotBlocks - Readme
In this repository, you can find the source files for three different construction systems, designed for building small robots. All three systems are designed to be used with [Misumi 3 Series](http://uk.misumi-ec.com/eu/ItemDetail/10300465870.html) aluminum extrusions, but should also be compatible with [OpenBeam](http://www.openbeamusa.com).  

Each system provides 3 different types of connectors, but the principles can be adapted to suit other purposes, so feel free to modify!  
- 90Â° corner connector  
- [Geared DC motor connector](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Freeshipping-5-set-Smart-Car-robot-wheel-with-3V-6V-DC-gear-Motor-single-axie/603126_723485364.html)  
- Micro servo connector  

##System 1 - Laser-cut connectors
Cut from 3mm ABS sheet, acrylic is not recommended due to the material's brittleness.  
Requires 4 M3 nuts and 4 M3x6 screws per connector.
Hex socket cap screws are recommended for easier assembly in tight spaces.

##System 2 - Printed friction-fit connectors
Printed in PLA on an Ultimaker 1, 0.1mm layer height, 20% infill density.  
Other settings and different materials can be used for increased strength.  
No extra fasteners needed.

##System 3 - Printed "Hybrid"
Printed in PLA on an Ultimaker 1, 0.1mm layer height, 20% infill density.  
Other settings and different materials can be used for increased strength.  
Requires 2 M3 nuts and 2 M3x10 screws per connector.
Hex socket cap screws are recommended for easier assembly in tight spaces.
